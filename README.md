# theScoreApp

Project Name: theScoreApp

Description: This project demonstrates the usage of Appium with Selenium using the TestNG framework for theScore app automation testing.

Installation:
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine.
Install Android Studio and set up Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) for testing on different Android versions.
Install Appium using npm (Node Package Manager) or any other preferred method.
Set up the necessary environment variables for Java, Android, and Appium.
Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Import the project into the IDE and ensure that all dependencies are resolved.

Configuration:
Update the desired capabilities in the test configuration file to specify the device, platform, app package, and other relevant details.

Usage:
Run the testng.xml file as a TestNG suite to execute the automated tests.
View the test execution results and logs in the IDE console or test report generated by TestNG.

Note: 
Make sure Appium Server is running in the background as I did not automate that step because it was not working for me on my mac machine
